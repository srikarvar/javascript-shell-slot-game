# Mini Javascript Project to practice javascript
It's a shell based slot machine game where you can:
1. choose your deposit amount initially
2. choose a bet per line across the reels of the slot 
3. choose no of lines you want to bet on. 
It spins the the slot and returns the winnings. It keeps a track of your deposit and winnings. 

I've been a little rusty with JS as it's been a year since I worked on it, so i thought i'll do a small project. Take this as an idea and build your own.

To run:
node project.js
